## Introduction
Excelling at problem solving requires being a good strategist. Following are the strategies for algorithm desgin.
    
## 3.1 - Iteration
Iterative strategy consists of using loops (*for*, *while*) to repeat a process until a condition is met. Each step in a loop is called an iteration.

Running thought an input and applying the same operations on every part of it.
